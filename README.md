trnySim
=======
Overview
--------
The purpose of this program is to study the effectiveness of different tournament 
formats through simulation. Although still in development, trnySim is able to 
analyze the fairness of the results of a tournament in terms of the position 
achieved by a team against the expected position according to a team's rating. 
It is intended that once finished, this program will allow users to analyze 
their ideas for tournament designs. Currently football (soccer) type league 
tournament simulators are implemented, and football Swiss tournament are 
almost done; the next steps will be knock-out and composite tournaments 
(multi-phase tournaments, i.e. top 4 classify to a play-off). Although not 
its main purpose, this program can be used as a library to create a generator 
of tournament schedules.

Installation & Usage
--------------------
No installation is required as this program is intended to be a library. 
Users are required to have a working Java programming environment (JDK) and 
enough programming skills to build a script to simulate their tournament designs, 
in a way similar as it is demonstrated in the trnySim.java file.
